        <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>For the past three years I have been spending my time repairing my summer home damaged by Hurricane Sandy, volunteering as an educator at the Cradle of Aviation museum and Last Hope Animal Shelter, training for a half iron man triathlon and learning web development.</p>

<p>My qualifications include studies in Capability Maturity Models (CMMI), a Certificate in Project Management for IS/IT Professionals from Villanova, and more than eighteen years of application development, project management and team lead experience.</p>  

<p>During my career with Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), I managed staff and IT projects for the largest financial services post-trade infrastructure in the world. DTCC is a $23 trillion holding company for six subsidiaries providing clearance, settlement and IS for $1.7 trillion daily transactions in equity, corporate/municipal debt, government/mortgage-backed securities and emerging market sovereign debt trades in the USA.</p>

<p>Beginning as a Purchasing Agent, I rapidly moved into software development and programming, working as IT Project Leader designing a DB2 database driven Trade Repository application able to process more than fifteen million trade records daily.</p>

<p>As an Area Process Specialist I was a key player in meeting the corporate objective of Level 3 CCMI Certification, providing comprehensive process management and team leadership focused on process transformation, on the implementation-related aspects of work products, team workflow, and project methodology usage and tools utilization.</p>

<p>I was a Team Lead responsible for overseeing the design, build and implementation of mission critical systems.</p>  

<p class="bold">My current goal is to utilize my expertise in project management, applications development, business analysis and team management to launch a second career as a freelance web developer.</p>
